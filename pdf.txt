Hi 
Creative, Confident, Adventurous, Driven, Cheerful, Collaborative, Dreamer, Enthusiastic, 
Curious, Courageous 
Welcome 
Stella Xulin 
Order: Writing, Lab, Robotics, Music, Cheer, Art, academics 
Writing section:  
A poetic scroll through time, like scrolling through a journey to show growth in my writing as they 
read: 
1. (give the chinese writings with translation) 
I love the feeling of a pen between my fingers, 
its smooth body resting against my skin, 
ink staining faintly, 
a deep blue that lingers after I have written too long. 
When I was one, during ZhuaZhou, 
a tradition where a child’s first grasp predicts her destiny, 
I reached for a black Parker pen 
instead of the spoon, cookie, or silk dress before me. 
Each night beneath the yellow lamp, 
my mother read poems aloud. 
I traced the rhythm of her voice with my finger 
as if I could hold its shape. 
Sometimes she placed her pen in my hand, 
and I learned how a single stroke could hold emotion. 
Those were my first stories, 
camellias in rain, 
the scent of paper and tea, 
the hush of a courtyard that never stopped listening. 
2.  (some bad writings) 
Then we moved across the ocean. 
For the first time, I dropped the pen. 
English bent oddly in my mouth. 
My handwriting tilted. 
My words felt fragile and uncertain. 
I stayed quiet, watching others speak with ease. 
3.  (show some writing process) 
Then I began again. 
My first sentences wobbled, 
half in English, half in Chinese. 
They were not perfect, 
but they were mine. 
I filled notebooks with fragments, 
thoughts between classes, 
lines written before sleep, 
tiny worlds forming in ink. 
Each word felt like a step closer to home. 
At the kitchen table, 
I practiced pronunciation with my sister, 
turning film into flim, receipt into recipe, 
laughing until our stomachs hurt. 
Sometimes we translated old Chinese poems, 
our voices blending softly, 
half Mandarin, half English, 
fully ours. 
IV. (nice writings - make a beautiful collection, booking looking) 
Slowly, I learned to write again. 
Through language, I found a new beginning. 
I wrote letters, reflections, and essays, 
then I found poetry. 
Poetry taught me to listen, 
to pause between words, 
to let silence speak. 
Now I write to remember and to connect, 
to keep alive the two worlds that shaped me. 
The courtyard in China where I first held a pen, 
and the quiet corners in America 
where I learned to speak again. 
Ink still stains my fingers. 
And I continue to write.

Music section: (personal + the club) 
Intro:  
Music has been part of my life since I was six, when the piano first became a place of calm and 
discovery. From Schubert’s Impromptu No. 4, Op. 90 to the Chinese classic Liangzhu, I’ve found 
meaning in both the elegance of Western composition and the emotion of traditional Chinese 
storytelling. I have performed in numerous school music programs and community concerts, and 
I enjoy tutoring younger students, helping them build a strong foundation and love for piano. As 
a member of The Hartford Music Teachers Alliance, I continue to grow as a pianist and 
performer, recently earning first place and a gold medal in the HMTA Rising Pianists 
Competition with the highest score in the high school division. 
Performance videos (i will put the videos in the shared album if thats easier but heres the ones 
in youtube, but i dont want them get directed to youtube)

(There is a few more I will show you) 
Club: 
What began as a personal passion soon grew into something larger. I founded the Farmington 
Music Students Association to share the joy of music beyond the stage. Our group grew quickly, 
bringing live performances to schools, hospitals, and retirement homes. Each concert reminds 
me that music can heal, connect, and bring light to those who need it most. 
Data: 60+ members, 400+ residents with disabilities 
Pictures and videos of performances.

Curiosity led me to explore the harmony between music and science. Through Scholars in 
Sound, I examine the therapeutic power of music and how technology can amplify its reach. Our 
team publishes student-written articles, curates performance videos in collaboration with artists 
from Vancouver, China, Australia, Spain, and Korea, and develops AI-generated compositions 
and playlists crafted to comfort and inspire. We also interview seniors about how music has 
shaped their lives, gathering stories of memory, emotion, and connection that guide our creative 
process. This expanding interdisciplinary library serves as a source of solace for patients while 
uniting art, technology, and healing. Our student-coded AI further empowers elders to engage 
with the digital world through the universal language of music.

Robot Support (leadership):  
As the selected team lead of a 60+ member robotics program, I oversee mechanical design, 
strategy, and outreach across competition seasons. I lead efforts in robot design, CAD 
modeling, field element construction, autonomous navigation, and sensor integration.  
Under my leadership, our team increased female membership by 50% and earned multiple 
honors, including the Team Sustainability Award and Gracious Professionalism Award at both 
state and regional levels in 2024 and 2025. 
Outreach 
Beyond the lab, I am also an active outreach. I help expand access to STEAM education across 
Connecticut. Through interactive programs and partnerships, I work with students of all ages to 
make science, technology, and creativity approachable, inspiring, and fun.  
1. FIRST LEGO League Mentorship 
Within the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) branch of outreach, I mentor students ages 9–14 through 
full 14-session seasons. I teach coding, design thinking, and collaboration while guiding teams 
through research and robot challenges. I also teach introductory engineering classes at local 
elementary schools, helping young students discover confidence and joy through STEM. 
2. Rockin’ Robotics 
Through Rockin’ Robotics, I engage young learners in hands-on STEAM workshops that 
combine engineering and imagination. Working with library programs in Farmington and West 
Hartford, our sessions have grown from three to five each year, reaching more than 270 
students through activities that make science come alive.

3. STEAM Day 
During STEAM Day events, I help bring full-day, schoolwide programs to local elementary 
schools. Each rotation of activities allows students to explore topics like circuitry, motion, and 
design in a playful setting. These events transform classrooms into creative labs, giving every 
child a chance to build, experiment, and learn. 
4. Farmington Valley Robotics Expo 
I participate in organizing and leading the Farmington Valley Robotics Expo, a celebration of 
local FIRST programs that unites FLL, FTC, and FRC teams. Over the past three years, this 
outreach has mentored 29 Explore and 8 Discover teams, reaching more than 270 students 
across five towns. The Expo showcases student-built robots, hosts demonstrations, and 
highlights how teamwork and innovation connect all levels of robotics. 
5. Central Connecticut Robotics Alliance 
As part of the Central Connecticut Robotics Alliance, I collaborate with partner teams to host 
Gold Tournaments that raise funds for a shared robotics community space. This partnership 
strengthens the regional network of teams and supports long-term access to training and 
competition resources. 
6. I am a designer in the team: Fun fact, I designed the team logo and team shirt.

Cheerleading: 
“Let’s get fired up and show ’em what you got!” 
That chant still echoes in my head every time I step onto the mat. Cheer taught me strength in 
balance and grace under pressure. From long practices to championship floors, it became more 
than a sport; it became a language of trust and precision. As a four-time All-Academic athlete, 
Most Improved awardee, and CCC nominee, I have grown as both a performer and a leader. I 
have coached elementary, middle school, and unified teams, and helped our squad to earn the 
first CCC championship in school history.

Lab: 
At the Yan Lab in the Yale School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology, I studied the function 
of Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs), ancient viral sequences often considered “junk DNA.” My 
project focused on reactivating these ERVs through precise epigenetic editing to better 
understand their role in cancer and immunity. 
I constructed the lab’s central molecular tool, a Cas9 KDM4D fusion protein designed to remove 
repressive H3K9me3 histone marks from ERV loci. I designed primers, performed PCR-based 
molecular cloning, and successfully assembled the lentiviral plasmid carrying our editor. After 
delivering the construct into target cells, I validated its expression through Western blot analysis. 
This validated construct became the foundation for the lab’s large-scale study on ERV function, 
enabling new exploration into how ERV reactivation may influence tumor biology and immune 
responses. I concluded my research by presenting my methods and results at a formal Yan Lab 
meeting at Yale. 
Website of the lab: https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/yan/research/  
Research: 
Melanoma and Endogenous Retroviruses 
Figure 1. Reactivation of Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) as a potential mechanism for 
anti-tumor immunity. 
Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) are ancient viral elements that make up nearly 8% of the 
human genome. Once infectious, these sequences are now silenced by epigenetic 
modifications such as H3K9me3 to preserve genomic stability. Recent studies suggest that 
reactivation of ERVs in tumor cells can mimic viral infection and stimulate strong immune 
responses against cancer. This phenomenon, known as viral mimicry, represents an emerging 
direction in melanoma immunotherapy research. 
Figure 2. Diagram illustrating the concept of viral mimicry and ERV-driven immune activation. 
At the Yale School of Medicine, the Yan Laboratory studies how histone demethylases regulate 
ERV silencing and how their dysregulation affects cancer progression and immune response. In 
this context, I contributed to the lab’s ongoing effort to understand the functional role of ERV 
reactivation through precise epigenetic editing. 
Project Focus: Locus-Specific Reactivation of ERVs 
Figure 3. Design of a dCas9-KDM4D fusion construct for targeted epigenetic editing. 
My research focused on developing a molecular tool to specifically reactivate ERVs by removing 
repressive histone marks. I constructed a dCas9-KDM4D fusion protein, engineered to erase 
H3K9me3 at ERV loci without altering the rest of the genome. To achieve this, I designed 
primers and performed PCR-based molecular cloning to assemble the lentiviral plasmid carrying 
the fusion construct. 
After verifying correct assembly through colony screening and sequencing, I transfected 
mammalian cells and confirmed expression of the fusion protein by Western blot analysis. This 
validated system now serves as the foundation for the lab’s functional screening platform that 
will map which ERV families most strongly influence anti-tumor immunity in melanoma. 
Research Impact 
Figure 4. Model of CRISPR-based epigenetic reactivation of ERVs and downstream immune 
response. 

The successful construction and validation of the dCas9-KDM4D epigenetic editor enable the 
lab to study ERV activation with unprecedented precision. This tool provides a framework for 
exploring how epigenetic regulation of viral elements shapes the tumor microenvironment and 
immune signaling. 
By contributing to this project, I helped establish a critical molecular platform that supports the 
lab’s broader goal of uncovering how chromatin modifications influence cancer immunity. The 
insights gained may ultimately inform new therapeutic strategies that harness the body’s 
immune system to recognize and eliminate tumor cells.
